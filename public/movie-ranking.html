<h1>The best movies according to Carolina</h1>

<h2>My top three movies of all time </h2>

<hr />

<h3>Sense and Sensibility (1995)</h3>
<p>Directed by Ang Lee and played by Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson, Kate Winslet and many more brilliant english actors. <br />
     It's based on the homonymous novel of Jane Austen, one of my favourites.</p>

<h3>Troy (2004)</h3>
<p>This one directed by Wolfgang Petersen, played by Brad Pitt as Achilles and Eric Bana as Hector from the epic poem of Homer, the Illiad, that I'm fond of.</p>

<h3>The Godfather (1972)</h3>
<p>Directed by Francis Coppola, displays the story of a powerful clan of sicilian descent, the Corleone's family, the cornerstone of the mafia in New York.</p>
